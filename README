HTML-Tree
---------

This is a collection of modules that represent, create and extract
information from HTML syntax trees.  These modules used to be part of
the libwww-perl distribution, but are now unbundled in order to
facilitate a separate development track.  Bug reports and discussions
about these modules can still be sent to the <libwww-perl@ics.uci.edu>
mailing list.

The following modules are present in this collection:

  HTML::Element - represents the nodes of the HTML syntax trees.  The
        elements have other elements and text segments as children.

  HTML::TreeBuilder - an HTML::Parser subclass that builds an HTML
        syntax tree from HTML document text.

  HTML::AsSubs - Easy way to build a syntax tree by nesting functions.

  HTML::Formatter - Base class for various formatters.  Formatters
        traverse a syntax tree and produce some textual output.  None
        of the current formatters handle tables or forms.

  HTML::FormatText - Converts a syntax tree to plain readable text.

  HTML::FormatPS - Outputs PostScript code.



PREREQUISITES

In order to install and use this package you will need Perl version
5.004 or better.  You will also need to have the HTML::Parser module
installed.  If you intend to use the PostScript formatter you need the
Font-AFM distribution.  All of these should be available from CPAN.



INSTALLATION

You install these modules, as you would install any perl module
library, by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
