HTML-Tree
---------

This is a collection of modules that represent, create and extract
information from HTML syntax trees.  These modules used to be part of
the libwww-perl distribution, but are now unbundled in order to
facilitate a separate development track.  Bug reports and discussions
about these modules can still be sent to the <libwww-perl@ics.uci.edu>
mailing list.

The modules present in this collection are:

  HTML::Element - represents the nodes of the HTML syntax trees.  The
        elements have other elements and text segments as children.
        The HTML::Element class have methods to extract information
        and to manipulate the structure of the tree.

  HTML::TreeBuilder - an HTML::Parser subclass that builds an HTML
        syntax tree from HTML document text.  The idea was that it
        should manage to construct all the nodes that was not
        explicitly mentioned in the source too.

  HTML::AsSubs - Easy way to build a syntax tree by nesting functions.

  HTML::Formatter - Base class for various formatters.  Formatters
        traverse a syntax tree and produce some textual output.  None
        of the current formatters handle tables or forms yet.

  HTML::FormatText - Formatter that converts a syntax tree to plain
        readable text.

  HTML::FormatPS - Formatter that outputs PostScript code.
